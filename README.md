## Linear data structures.

__Operations on a doubly linked list:__

`append` - adding an element to the list.

`insert` - adding an element to the list by index.

`remove` - removing an element from the list by index.

`pop` - get and remove element from the list by index.

`find` - searching for an element in a doubly linked list.

`at` - getting an element in a doubly linked list by index.

`print` - doubly linked list output to console.

__Operations on a priority queue:__

`append` - adding an element to the priority queue.

`sort` - sort priority queue.

`array` - building a priority queue based on an array.

`pop` - get and remove element from the list by index.

`print` - doubly linked list output to console.

## Trees and Hash Table.

__Operations on a hash table:__

`append` - adding an element to the hash table.

`remove` - removing an element from the hash table by key.

`at` - get element from the list by key.

`print` - hash table output to console.

__Operations on a b-tree:__

`append` - adding an element to the hash table..

`remove` - removing an element form the b-tree.

`search` - searching for an element in a b tree.

`print` - b-tree output to console.
